# AnagramFinder

Made it as fast as i could.
For some reason first time for me was always around 30-40ms, but once you find an average over 10k tries, it was about 2ms


To use on windows cmd: java -jar anagramfinder.jar <PathToProject>\build\resources\main\lemmad.txt <random word you wish to find anagrams for>
  
can also use your own lemma file and it should work in other languages as well.
